**EZorder - Software Engineering Project**<br>
This repository contains a team based Point of Sale (POS) system developed over a 5 month semester for a
Software Engineering course. The project was built by a team of five students and used GitHub for version
control, collaboration, and project integration.

**Project Overview**<br>
The POS system simulates a restaurant enviroment with role based access for employees, manager, hosts,
and programmers. The system manages employee authentication, time tracking, table orders, menu items,
and receipt generation.

**Core Features**<br>
*Authentication & Roles*
- Login system using employee assigned ID numbers
- Role based access
-   Waiter: Open/close checks manage table orders, logout
-   Manager: Full system control (employees, menu, wages, time)
-   Host: Login access only
-   Programmer: Testing and system validation access

*Employee Time Tracking*
- Automatically tracks hours worked from login to logout
- Supports manager edits for time corrections and wage management

*Table & Order Management*
- Waiters can:
-   Select tables
-   Open and close checks
-   Add menu items to receipts
- Menu items are loaded from an Excel spreadsheet
- Closing a check:

*Manager Controls*
- Add, remove, and edit:
-   Menu items
-   Employee information
-   Wages and time records
- Full visibility into waiter activity and system data

*Team roles & Contribution*
- Team Lead/Full-Stack Developer (My Role)
-   Led system design and development
-   Coordinated tasks and milestones
-   Contributed to both front-end and back-end development
-   Integrated team components into cohesive system
- Developers (2 members)
-   Implemented specific system interactions and features
-   Worked on core programming components
- Documentation & Practices (2 members)
-   Documented system behavior, design decisions, and development practices

*Project Duration*
- 5 months (one academic semester)

*Purpose*
This projects demonstrates:
- Software engineering practices
- Team collaboration using GitHub
- Full-Stack development
- Role based system design
- Real world POS system functionality
